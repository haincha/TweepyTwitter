In order to use, you must have PySide installed. I am not 100% sure the requirements file works properly.

You can try "sudo pip install -r requirements.txt"

So, here is everything.

Qt - http://qt-project.org/downloads
PySide - http://qt-project.org/wiki/Category:LanguageBindings::PySide::Downloads
